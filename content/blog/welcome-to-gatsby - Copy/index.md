Youâ€™ll find this post in your `content/blog` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `gatsby develop`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `content/blog` directory. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

There's support for code snippets:

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!')
```

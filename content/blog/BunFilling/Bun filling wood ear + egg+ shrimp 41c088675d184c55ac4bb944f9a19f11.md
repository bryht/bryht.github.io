# Bun filling: wood ear + egg+ shrimp

This bun filling is the one I like most, it also has the "secret sauce",  which can be used for multiple ways. lets start prepare them one by one.

## 1.Secret sauce

- prepare the basic ingredients: chopped chilly(required), sugar(required), salt(required), garlic, spring onion.

- heat the oil and white sesame together, until the sesame become yellow, and the oil will become hot now.

- pour the oil into basic ingredients(you can left a bit for fry eggs later), the hot oil will use left heat to fry the ingredients, wait a while then add one spoon black vinegar, three spoon soy sauce.

> this 'secret sauce' is useful, not only for bun filling, if add some sesame sauce, then it will become hotpot dips and salad sauce.

## 2.Filling.

- Prepare wood ear, get some dry wood ear into bowl, sink them with about 30 minutes~ 1 hour(they become soft, and big), then chop them to piece like half nail big, don`t make it too small, it will lost texture.

- Prepare eggs, mix them with some salt, and fry them with the hot oil pan, stir them when frying, they will become small pieces.

## Mix them

The last step is mix the secret sauce, eggs and wood ear, shrimp will be used when filling, have a taste before filling. That is all.
